The aim of this analysis is to train several machine learning models to predict breast cancer from tumor quantitative features. An initial PCA is run to uncover potential
high dimensional structures and to assess the separability of the two classes. Several machine learning classifiers are assessed via nested cross-validation on the entire
dataset. The best models are subsequently tuned in order to enhance model performance.
